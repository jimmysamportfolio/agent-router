# Prohibited Items Policy

## 1.1 Weapons and Ammunition

Listings for firearms, ammunition, explosives, or any weapon designed to cause bodily harm are strictly prohibited. This includes replicas and deactivated weapons that could be mistaken for functional items. Accessories such as silencers, bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines are also banned regardless of local legality.

## 1.2 Controlled and Illegal Substances

No listing may offer controlled substances, recreational drugs, drug paraphernalia, or precursor chemicals. Prescription medications may not be resold under any circumstances. Supplements making unapproved medical claims (e.g., "cures cancer") are prohibited.

## 1.3 Hazardous Materials

Products containing asbestos, lead paint, or banned pesticides may not be listed. Recalled consumer products must be removed immediately upon recall notification. Listings for chemicals classified as toxic, corrosive, or flammable without proper safety labeling are prohibited.

## 1.4 Stolen and Illicitly Obtained Goods

Any item known or reasonably suspected to be stolen, looted, or obtained through fraud is prohibited. Sellers must be able to demonstrate legitimate provenance if challenged. Serial numbers must not be removed or obscured.

## 1.5 Human Remains and Protected Wildlife

Trade in human organs, tissue, or remains is prohibited without exception. Products derived from endangered or protected species under CITES are banned, including ivory, tortoiseshell, and certain exotic leathers. Taxidermy items require proof of legal acquisition.

## 1.6 Enforcement

Violations of this policy result in immediate listing removal. First offenses receive a warning. Repeated violations lead to seller suspension. Items flagged under §1.1 or §1.4 may be reported to law enforcement.
