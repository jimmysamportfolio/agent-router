# Restricted Categories Policy

## 3.1 Age-Restricted Products

Products legally restricted by age (alcohol, tobacco, vaping devices, adult content) may only be listed by verified sellers with appropriate licensing. Listings must include clear age restriction notices. Marketing language must not target or appeal to minors. Flavored vaping products marketed with candy or cartoon imagery are prohibited regardless of seller verification status.

## 3.2 Health and Medical Products

Over-the-counter health products may be listed if they carry proper regulatory labeling (FDA, CE, or equivalent). No listing may make therapeutic claims unless the product has regulatory approval for those claims. Terms like "clinically proven" or "doctor recommended" require verifiable substantiation. Home medical devices (blood pressure monitors, thermometers) are permitted; prescription-only devices (CPAP machines, insulin pumps) require seller verification.

## 3.3 Financial Products and Services

Listings for financial instruments, cryptocurrency mining equipment, or investment-related services must include appropriate risk disclosures. Gift cards may be resold but must be verifiably unused. Listings for credit repair services, debt settlement, or similar financial services are prohibited. NFTs and digital assets may not be listed.

## 3.4 Automotive and Vehicle Parts

Safety-critical automotive parts (brake components, airbags, structural elements) must be listed as either OEM or clearly labeled aftermarket. Used airbags and seatbelt assemblies are prohibited. Emissions defeat devices and odometer tampering tools are prohibited. Vehicle listings must disclose salvage or rebuilt title status.

## 3.5 Food and Consumables

Homemade food items must comply with local cottage food regulations and include ingredient lists and allergen warnings. Expired food products may not be listed. Supplements must list all ingredients and may not contain banned substances. Raw milk and unpasteurized products must be clearly labeled with health advisories.

## 3.6 Enforcement

Listings in restricted categories without required disclosures or verifications are placed in a pending review state. Sellers have 48 hours to provide required documentation. Failure to comply results in listing removal. Repeated failures to provide required documentation result in category-level selling restrictions.
