# Listing Quality Standards

## 4.1 Title Requirements

Listing titles must accurately describe the product being sold. Titles must not exceed 150 characters. Keyword stuffing (repeating terms or adding unrelated search terms) is prohibited. All-caps titles are not permitted. Titles must be in the primary language of the marketplace region. Emoji usage in titles is limited to two characters maximum.

## 4.2 Description Accuracy

Product descriptions must truthfully represent the item's condition, features, dimensions, and included accessories. The following condition grades must be used consistently: New (unused, original packaging), Like New (unused, opened packaging), Good (minor cosmetic wear, fully functional), Fair (visible wear, fully functional), Poor (significant wear or minor functional issues, disclosed). Descriptions must not contain hidden text, excessive whitespace, or embedded links to external marketplaces.

## 4.3 Image Standards

Listings must include at least one clear photograph of the actual item being sold. Stock photos are permitted only for new, sealed products and must be supplemented with at least one photo of the actual item. Images must not contain watermarks from other marketplaces. Misleading photo editing (e.g., altering color, removing defects) is prohibited. Images must not contain overlay text exceeding 20% of the image area.

## 4.4 Pricing Integrity

Listed prices must reflect the actual transaction price. Artificially inflated prices intended to make discounts appear larger are prohibited. Prices listed as "$0" or "$0.01" to circumvent listing fees or manipulate search rankings result in immediate listing removal. Shipping costs must not be manipulated to obscure the true total price (e.g., $1 item with $50 shipping for a standard product).

## 4.5 Category Accuracy

Listings must be placed in the most specific applicable category. Intentional miscategorization to gain visibility in less competitive categories is prohibited. Products spanning multiple categories should be placed in the primary use-case category. Duplicate listings across multiple categories are not permitted.

## 4.6 Prohibited Listing Practices

The following practices result in listing removal: bait-and-switch (listing one product but delivering another), shill bidding or fake reviews, contact information in listings designed to circumvent marketplace transactions, and listings that exist solely to promote external websites or services.

## 4.7 Enforcement

Listings failing quality standards are flagged for revision. Sellers receive specific guidance on required changes. Listings not corrected within 72 hours are removed. Sellers with more than 30% of listings flagged within a rolling 30-day period receive a quality warning. Three quality warnings within 90 days result in a temporary selling suspension.
