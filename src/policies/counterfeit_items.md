# Counterfeit and Intellectual Property Policy

## 2.1 Counterfeit Goods

Listings offering counterfeit, fake, or replica products that bear the trademark or trade dress of another brand without authorization are strictly prohibited. This includes items described as "inspired by," "style of," or "similar to" a branded product when the item imitates protected brand elements such as logos, patterns, or distinctive design features.

## 2.2 Indicators of Counterfeit Products

The following patterns are strong indicators of counterfeit goods and should trigger elevated scrutiny:

- Price significantly below typical market value (generally 60% or more below retail) for claimed brand
- Use of brand names in the title with qualifiers like "authentic," "real," or "100% genuine" combined with anomalous pricing
- Stock photos or images clearly taken from official brand websites rather than photos of the actual item
- Seller history showing multiple listings of the same luxury brand at discounted prices
- Shipping origin inconsistent with the brand's known manufacturing locations

## 2.3 Trademark and Brand Misuse

Sellers may not use trademarked brand names in listing titles or descriptions unless the item is a genuine product of that brand. Using brand names for SEO purposes (e.g., "NOT Nike but similar quality") is considered trademark misuse. Comparative references must be clearly distinguishable from brand affiliation.

## 2.4 Copyright Infringement

Listings must not offer unauthorized reproductions of copyrighted works including but not limited to: pirated software, copied artwork or prints, bootleg recordings, unauthorized merchandise featuring copyrighted characters or designs, and unlicensed pattern reproductions.

## 2.5 Patent Violations

Products that are known to infringe on active utility or design patents may be removed upon verified complaint from the patent holder. The marketplace operates a notice-and-takedown process for patent disputes.

## 2.6 Enforcement

Counterfeit listings under §2.1 are removed immediately with no warning. Sellers receive a first-offense suspension of 7 days. Second offense results in permanent ban. Affected brand owners are notified when counterfeit goods are detected.
